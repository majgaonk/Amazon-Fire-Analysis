# Amazon-Fire-Analysis

Project to showcase the usage of pandas using a csv file. The csv file used captures the amazon fire data.

Short Description: Having learnt pandas, I wanted to do a sample project to re-inforce the various pandas concepts that I had learnt. This project is an attempt to do that and 
it showcases pandas concepts like ingesting data from csv, applying a map function, pivoting the dataframe, using groupby, plotting and multiindexing. The csv file I used was on 
Kaggle.com and it contains data about the Amazon fires.
